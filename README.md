# Word2vec-Cosine-Algorithm
The cosine similarity ranges between -1 and 1. If two vectors are perfectly the same, then their cosine score is 1. If two vectors are opposite, their similarity score is -1. If two vectors are perpendicular to each other, they have a similarity score of 0. This project finds the higher frequency of cosine score of 1 or close to 1.
